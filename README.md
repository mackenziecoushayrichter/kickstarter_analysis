# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project utilizes data from global Kickstarter campaigns to analyze trends.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to focus on the data from theater kickstarter campaigns.  Then to analyze if there were trends in the data telling if the campaign would be successful or not, related to the campaigns launch date and funding goal.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To complete this analysis, first I looked at the success rate of the campaigns based on the month they were launched.  Using the data, I grouped the campaigns based on the month they were created.  I then created a pivot table to count the number of theater campaigns successful, failed, and canceled in each month.  The graph below shows the number of either successful, canceled, or failed theater campaigns by month for the years 2009 to 2017.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The second way I analyzed the data was to compare the campaigns fundraising goal against if the campaign was successful, failed, or canceled. For this analysis I used the data from theater play campaigns from the years 2009 to 2017.  To complete this analysis, I first grouped the campaigns based on their fundraising goals, starting at below $1,000 and then increased the groupings in increments of $5,000 up to over $50,000.  I then created a chart to count the number of successful, canceled, and failed campagins in each fundraisng grouping.  Then from that calcuated the percentage of successful, canceled, and failed campaigns in each fundraising group.  I created the graph below from my findings which shows the percentage of either successful, failed, or canceled campaigns based on its fundraising $ goal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
